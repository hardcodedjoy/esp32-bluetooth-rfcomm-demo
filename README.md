Control ESP32 board from your Android phone, using the RoboRemo app.

RoboRemo can connect via Bluetooth (RFCOMM / BLE), WiFi (TCP / UDP / TCP Server), USB Serial.

In this example, the ESP32 is configured as Bluetooth RFCOMM device, with ginen name "ESP32-RFCOMM"

Android Phone is paired to the "ESP32-RFCOMM" bluetooth device.

Then RoboRemo app connects (via Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol) to the ESP32.

Bi-directional real-time communication is achieved.

Project can be further extended in order to build a Bluetooth-controlled IoT device, robot, etc. based on ESP32 boards.
